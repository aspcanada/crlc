  description: `The Cottonwood Rose Learning Community is a nature-based education program in Black Creek at the north end of the Comox Valley. The program is operated by the Cottonwood Rose Farm Forest and Nature Learning Society.

Ours is a K-9 program that brings a nature based curriculum to life through partnership with Heartwood Learning Communities through NIDES at SD-71 and Hand in Hand Nature Education. The program is made viable through a supportive community of parent volunteers and mentors who further enrich and enliven the journey.

For 3 days each week of the school year, (Tue/Wed/Thur) 3 mixed age cohorts engage with the learning objectives of the BC-curriculum but finessed through the lens of nature. Mondays and Fridays are home learning days where kids will continue their project based work at home.`,
  volunteerNote:
    "As a learning community it's important to note that families are enrolled as active participants. Whether it's supervision or chores this means about 4-5 hours of volunteer time per family, per month. Parent volunteer time is essential to making it all work. We have a committed PAC group that meets regularly and needs your hands and voice!",
  fees: "Program fees operate on a sliding scale fee $197-$279 / month for 1 student and $355 - $497/month for 2 students. Registered families also receive $600 of provincial funding for each student a year that is paid to our nature education partners.",

  title: "The Land",
  description: `Cottonwood Rose is a multi-family project, imagined as a living home for the kind of work, education, and community our world so deeply needs. On 46 forested acres, trails wind through the forest to classrooms, gardens, and gathering spaces along Bear Creek and the neighbouring parklands.

At its heart, Cottonwood Rose is about reconnection—of self, community, and nature. Here, we host healing retreats, honour Indigenous wisdom, and nurture a vision of education rooted in relationship. Children explore forest and field, get their hands dirty in the budding farm project, help care for animals, and learn the rhythms of the land.

Supported by global Workaway visitors and families who now call this land home, Cottonwood Rose continues to grow as a place of learning, stewardship, and community—a living invitation to belong, to contribute, and to remember our place in the web of life.`,

  message: `Hey folks!

We are Julianna, John, Finn and Christina.

Our family was inspired to kick off this project because we believe education is more than classrooms—it's about community, connection, and shared purpose.

We wish for our children to grow up inspired by the land, guided by mentors, and supported by friends who feel like family.

By learning together outdoors, through song, story, craft, and exploration, we hope to nurture resilience, creativity, and joy in these kids.

For us, this is about more than just school—it's about re-imagining how we raise the next generation, creating meaningful change, and building a stronger, more connected community that is rooted in care for each other and the earth.

We would love to have you join us and together we can make this something beautiful!`,
